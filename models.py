        extensions: A frozen set of file extensions (e.g., ".py", ".ts") that identify
            source code files for the target language.
        signals: A frozen set of signal file names (e.g., "__init__.py", "index.js") that
            strongly indicate a module root, even without explicit manifests.
        ignore_dirs: A frozen set of directories which we should ignore (e.g., "tests", "mocks")
