"""
Sential CLI Entry Point.

This module implements the main command-line interface for Sential, a tool designed
to generate high-signal context bridges from local Git repositories. It orchestrates
the scanning pipeline by filtering files based on language-specific heuristics,
scoping the scan to specific modules (monorepo support), and aggregating both
raw file content (for context) and code symbols (via Universal Ctags).

The pipeline operates in four distinct stages:

1.  **Validation & Selection**: Verifies the target path is a valid Git repository
    and handles interactive user selection for the target programming language and
    application scopes (modules).
2.  **Inventory Generation**: Streams the Git index to separate files into 'Language'
    (source code) and 'Context' (manifests/docs) buckets using the "Language Sieve"
    approach defined in `constants.py`.
3.  **Content Extraction**: Reads high-priority context files in full (with intelligent
    truncation) to establish the repository's configuration and documentation baseline.
4.  **Symbol Extraction**: Pipes source files through Universal Ctags to extract structural
    code symbols (classes, functions, definitions) without including full implementation
    details, optimizing token usage for downstream consumption.

Usage:
    Run directly as a script or via the installed entry point.

    $ python main.py --path /path/to/repo --language Python

Dependencies:
    - Typer: CLI argument parsing and app structure.
    - Rich: Terminal UI, colors, and progress visualization.
    - Inquirer: Interactive terminal user prompts.
    - Universal Ctags: External engine used for symbol extraction.

    The main entry point for the Sential CLI application.

    This function orchestrates the entire scanning process. It validates that the
    provided path is a valid Git repository, determines the programming language

    application scopes (modules), and generates a final JSONL payload containing
    context files and code symbols (ctags).

            directory and a valid Git repository. Defaults to the current working directory.
        language (str): The target programming language for the scan. If not provided
            via CLI arguments, the user will be prompted to select one interactively.
