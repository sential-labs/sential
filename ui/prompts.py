"""
Interactive user prompts for the Sential CLI application.

This module provides interactive terminal prompts that guide users through the
configuration of Sential scans. It handles two main interactive flows:

1. Language Selection: Prompts users to select a programming language when
   not provided via command-line arguments.

2. Scope Selection: Identifies potential modules in the repository and presents
   them in a hierarchical tree structure, allowing users to select which modules
   (scopes) to include in the scan. Automatically filters out redundant nested
   child modules when a parent is selected.

The module uses the `inquirer` library for interactive prompts and `rich` for
formatted terminal output. It provides a `FileTreeBuilder` class for visualizing
module hierarchies with ASCII tree characters.

Dependencies:
    - inquirer: Interactive terminal prompts
    - rich: Terminal formatting and colors
    - typer: CLI framework integration
